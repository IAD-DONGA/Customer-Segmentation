# Customer-Segmentation
Implementation of customer segementation using  machine learning algorithm, the K-means clustering

Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, 
companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base.
It is the process that aims to  divide  customers into different segments of customers  based on several groups of 
individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, 
and miscellaneous spending habits. It is therefore necessary to look for characteristics shared by a sufficient number 
of people. These characteristics are called segmentation criteria.

The different criteria of segmentation 

---> Socio-economic criteria

---> Psychological criteria

---> Criteria related to purchasing behavior

---> Socio-demographic criteria

---> Organizational criteria

In this machine learning project, we will make use of K-means clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled dataset.
